                    <section class="post-content">
			<p>A few years ago I discovered the <a href="http://nest.com">nest</a> thermostat. It looked nice, is connected to the internet, self learning but a bit expensive and not so much documentation if it will work in Belgium nor with the boiler we have installed (Vaillant TurboTec).</p>
<p>Doing some research on the internet I figured that they have updated their system software and are supporting European countries including Belgium. A solution for the power has also been found by an ICY converter so it could easily be implemented in setups where no power is transferred over those wires.</p>
<p>So I had only to tackle the price, you could order one using the official nest store of the <a href="http://store.nest.com/uk/">UK</a> but then you would pay about € 300 euro's for only the device. And that was still too pricy for me.</p>
<p>Luckily you can find them for about € 190 on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B009GDHYPQ/ref=sr_1_1_olp?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401011588&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=nest&amp;condition=new">amazon</a>, you have to take into account the shipping and handling fee, € 8 and the import fees € 42. Together with the <a href="http://www.eco-logisch.be/Details.asp?ProductID=3484&amp;category=115">ICY converter</a> which is about € 50 you have the whole setup for about € 290.</p>
<p>So you could save some money by ordering with amazon!</p>
<p>Convincing myself it's worth the money, and it could save me some on the very long term I took the plunge and ordered one so I could enjoy those geeky features. (Doing so my girlfriend is convinced I'm a nerd, especially because I'm also blogging about it right now)</p>
<p>It only took a couple of days to have those 2 packages delivered and I could start playing around with it.</p>
<h1>Unboxing</h1>
<p>The nest comes into an hipster sleek box.</p>
<p><img alt="nest-boxes" src="../../images/nest/nest-boxes.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's almost the same feeling as unboxing the ipod I bought about 10 years ago. Opening the box the first thing which you discover is the nifty looking product itself.</p>
<p><img alt="nest-unboxing-one" src="../../images/nest/nest-unboxing-one.jpg" /></p>
<p>Underneath the nest display a whole bunch of stuff is packed, a paper guide, cool looking screw driver, a couple of mount plates, some screws and the base plate to connect the wires too.</p>
<p><img alt="nest-unboxing-all" src="../../images/nest/nest-unboxing-all.jpg" /></p>
<h1>Initialization</h1>
<p>First thing I did was charging the display using a micro USB cable, so I could start configuring it afterwards without being disrupted due to a low battery.</p>
<p><img alt="nest-charging" src="../../images/nest/nest-charging.jpg" /></p>
<p>After a night of charging I started configuring the thermostat by first connecting it to our wireless network (using a WPA2 encryption) without any hassle it got connected and started downloading the latest updates</p>
<p><img alt="nest-updating" src="../../images/nest/nest-updating.jpg" /></p>
<p>After the updated had been downloaded and got installed the device rebooted itself and was ready for the real work.</p>
<h1>Old thermostat</h1>
<p>Before I could get started I had to remove our current thermostat, a Honeywell CM907. I went ahead after I shut down power from our boiler which is connected to the thermostat.</p>
<p><img alt="honeywell" src="../../images/nest/honeywell.jpg" /></p>
<p>This can be done easily once I figured out how, you have to remove the cover, battery lid and batteries. In the battery compartment I marked two little arrows which indicates being clips you can unlock using a screw driver. Once I got ejected that control panel I got to the wiring underneath.</p>
<p><img alt="disassembling-desk" src="../../images/nest/disassembling-desk.jpg" /></p>
<p>I wrote down the current wired setup on a sticker and putted it on that plastic base mount. That way I could easily roll back if anything will go wrong in the near or far away future.</p>
<p><img alt="dismantled-honeywell" src="../../images/nest/dismantled-honeywell.jpg" /></p>
<h1>Wiring</h1>
<h2>ICY connection</h2>
<p>Doing my research on the net I came to the issue of powering your nest device. In Europe most devices are powered by batteries, unfortunately the nest device doesn't. To solve this issue you could use a so called ICY converter. I had to cut the wires coming from my boiler to the thermostat itself.</p>
<p><img alt="cutting-wires" src="../../images/nest/cutting-wires.jpg" /></p>
<p>Next step was to connect the wires from the boiler to the CV clips on the converter and the wires going to the thermostat on the Th clips.</p>
<p><img alt="ICY-converter" src="../../images/nest/ICY-convertor.jpg" /></p>
<p>After connecting all the wires I did not yet plugged the converter in. I first installed the mount plate for the base of the nest before powering on all the electrical devices.</p>
<p><img alt="ICY-connector" src="../../images/nest/ICY-connector.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Mountplate</h2>
<p>After disassembling my old thermostat I discovered that the wall has some holes and missing paint behind that old mount plate. Luckily you could use the enclosed base cover to hide those imperfections. Once I drilled the holes, screwed the base plate onto the wall I could connect the wires. As you can see on the picture you have to connect on on the W1 port and one on the Rh port.</p>
<p><img alt="nest-wires" src="../../images/nest/nest-wires.jpg" /></p>
<p>When I then attached the display, powered on the boiler and plugged in the converter the nest asked configuration of the heating equipment I first got the <a href="http://support.nest.com/#troubleshooting/e24">E24</a> error which means no power is detected coming to the nest device. I switched the wires from W1 and Rh and repowered the boiler. Now I got the <a href="http://support.nest.com/#troubleshooting/n23">N23</a> looking at the support pages it's indicating you are using an unusual configuration but my boiler picked up signals coming from the nest thermostat.</p>
<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>I went to all the configuration steps, connecting to the wifi, adding to my online nest account, setting the auto-away options, ... and many more. Once that's done you could see on the screen that I turned the nest to it's minimal, 9° C and that on the moment of taking the picture it was 26° C inside the nest device.</p>
<p><img alt="nest-working" src="../../images/nest/nest-working.jpg" /></p>
<p>Since I took the decision to install this thermostat in the summer when we don't need the CV system I could not yet fully test the device. I didn't wanted to take the risk not having a working CV when it was cold.</p>
<p><img alt="nest-off" src="../../images/nest/nest-off.jpg" /></p>
<p>So I had to turn it off for now and will come back with a review of the usage in most likely december when the winter has taken his start over here in Belgium.</p>
<p>In the meantime I could see how I can collect this data, already found a nice <a href="https://github.com/gboudreau/nest-api">nest-api</a> which can deliver the data to <a href="https://github.com/chriseng/nestgraph">nest-graph</a> so I can report back to you with some neat graphs.</p>
